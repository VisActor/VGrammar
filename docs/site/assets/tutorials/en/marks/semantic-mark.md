# Semantic marks

Semantic marks in VGrammar describe a specific type of data semantics.

## Interval

Interval mark is used to represent a range of data sets, presented in bar intervals. In different coordinate systems, interval graphics can be used to create bar charts, histograms, rose charts, and other visualization effects.

Developers can choose either a cartesian or polar coordinate system to meet different visualization needs. In a cartesian coordinate system, interval mark is presented as rectangles; in a polar coordinate system, interval mark is presented as arcs.

The interval type is declared as `'interval'`.

Interval graphic rendering example:

<div class="examples-ref-container" id="examples-ref-interval" data-path="mark-interval/polar-interval">
</div>

## Cell

Cell mark is commonly used to represent the numerical proportion within a given data set's unit range and can be used to create heat maps and other visualization effects. The cell graphic type is declared as `'cell'`.

Cell graphic rendering example:

<div class="examples-ref-container" id="examples-ref-cell" data-path="mark-cell/calender-cell">
</div>
